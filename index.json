I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge (Trinity College), obtained under the supervision of Pietro Liò. My research concerns geometric deep learning—devising neural network architectures that respect the invariances and symmetries in data (a topic I’ve co-written a proto-book about). For my contributions to the area, I am recognised as an ELLIS Scholar in the Geometric Deep Learning Program. Within this area, I focus on graph representation learning and its applications in algorithmic reasoning and computational biology. In particular, I am the first author of Graph Attention Networks—a popular convolutional layer for graphs—and Deep Graph Infomax—a popular self-supervised learning pipeline for graphs (featured in ZDNet). My research has been used in substantially improving the travel-time predictions in Google Maps (featured in the CNBC, Endgadget, VentureBeat, CNET, the Verge and ZDNet), and guiding the intuition of mathematicians towards new top-tier theorems and conjectures (featured in Nature, New Scientist, The Independent, Sky News, The Sunday Times and The Conversation).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c55b3c80f2b1d49f6240a078096557c2","permalink":"https://caraml-group.github.io/author/petar-velickovic/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/petar-velickovic/","section":"authors","summary":"I’m Petar, a Staff Research Scientist at DeepMind, Affiliated Lecturer at the University of Cambridge, and an Associate of Clare Hall, Cambridge.

I have published in multiple areas of theoretical and applied machine learning covering ground from computational learning theory—for example, deriving bounds on the sample complexity of the cross-validation estimate—to applications in organelle proteomics, particularly data fusion for protein localization. My current research focuses on machine learning for automated theorem-proving. This field provides multiple challenges, not least that the sensitivity of most solvers to small changes in the complexity of a heuristic forces a dichotomy between fast, simple methods that maintain and possibly improve the inherent performance of the solver, versus more complex “deep” methods that, while they might make better decisions, often take much longer to do so, and as a result can reduce ultimate performance.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b18a61ebeffe566448720e0b775f78e3","permalink":"https://caraml-group.github.io/author/sean-holden/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/sean-holden/","section":"authors","summary":"I specialise in Machine Learning, with around three decades’ experience split mostly between my current post and a stint of several years at University College London, where I was Director of the Advanced Masters Programme in Intelligent Systems.","tags":null,"title":"Sean Holden","type":"authors"},{"authors":["simon-mathis"],"categories":null,"content":"Hi!

CaRAML - Cambridge Research \u0026amp; Applications in Machine Learning - is a community of machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers at the University of Cambridge. CaRAML aims to bring together Cambridge students, researchers, and faculty working in ML and AI across theory and practice.\nCaRAML is primarily a student-led effort, and not an official affliliation. Everyone is welcome to participate regardless of affiliation and experience.\n What are the goals of CaRAML? Community The primary goal of CaRAML is to build a community and bring likeminded people together via in-person social interactions and events. Events can range from research focussed meetups and reading groups, to socials at local restaurants and pubs, to activities such as sports or hikes.\nResearch Platform CaRAML also aims to provide a platform for sharing and disseminating research via blogposts and talks, as well as highlight members’ achievements via an active social media presence.\nThe CaRAML blog can host or link to blogposts written by members about their latest papers, commentaries on recent research advances, and beyond. The website supports markdown and LaTeX.\nCollaboration Channel Finally, CaRAML is an active Slack channel where members can collaborate on research projects, discuss papers in reading groups, advertise opportunities, organise social events, and much more.\n How did CaRAML start? CaRAML was started in 2020 (and restarted in 2022) by PhD students at the Computer Laboratory and their cross-departmental collaborators, with the goal of promoting AI and ML research happening across Cambridge and building a likeminded community.\n","date":1651276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660780800,"objectID":"e9842b72a57fa5d351bbf0a01c6fd828","permalink":"https://caraml-group.github.io/post/announcing-caraml/","publishdate":"2022-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/announcing-caraml/","section":"post","summary":"CaRAML brings together Cambridge researchers working in ML and AI across theory and practice.
